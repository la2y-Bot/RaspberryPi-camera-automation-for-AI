# Raspberry Pi Camera Automation
This repository provides a simple yet powerful framework for working with the Raspberry Pi camera module. It automates the entire workflow of [capture → analyze → output] in a continuous loop with a configurable delay.

Whether you want to build a real-time monitoring system, run lightweight computer vision tasks, or prototype automation projects, this repo gives you a strong starting point to seamlessly integrate the Pi camera into your application

🚀 Key Features

🔄 Continuous Automation – Automatically capture, process, and output results in a loop.

⏱️ Configurable Delay – Control the interval between each capture cycle.

🖼️ Pluggable Analysis – Easily integrate custom analysis logic (e.g., OpenCV, ML models).

⚡ Lightweight & Efficient – Optimized for Raspberry Pi’s limited resources.

🛠️ Extensible Design – Adaptable for projects like surveillance, IoT monitoring, or smart automation.
